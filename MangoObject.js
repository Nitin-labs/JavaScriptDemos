/* Object Literals
The most common and, indeed, the easiest way to create objects is with the object literal described here:*/
var hapus={
    name:"hapus",
    color:"Yellow",
    shape:"round",
    sweetness:8,

howSweetAmI: function(){
    console.log("Hmm Hmm Good")
    document.write("Hmm Hmm Good")
}
}
hapus.howSweetAmI()
